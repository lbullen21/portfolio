                Hi, I&apos;m Lauren Pe√±a, a passionate software engineer with a focus on 
                frontend development. I love creating beautiful and functional digital 
                experiences using modern web technologies and have a keen eye for user-centered design.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                With a background in both front-end and back-end development, I enjoy 
                working on projects that challenge me to learn new technologies and 
                solve complex problems. I have extensive experience working with AI tools 
                and design programs like Figma in an agile environment, collaborating with 
                cross-functional teams to deliver exceptional user experiences. I believe in 
                writing clean, maintainable code and creating intuitive user interfaces.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-8">
                When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me exploring and enjoying the great outdoors of Bend, Oregon.
